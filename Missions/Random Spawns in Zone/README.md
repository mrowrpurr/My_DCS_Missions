Defines a large zone encompassing Las Vegas and nearby locations.

Adds an F10 comms menu option to spawn a random hostile.

Hostiles are either:
- Mig-29
- Su-25
- Mirage F1
- Spitfire (_just cuz_)

They appear at a random location in the predefined zone at a random
elevation between 500 ft and 20,000 ft.
